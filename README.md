# TrollLEDs

 A TrollStore application to control individual flashlight LEDs for iOS devices.

 When used on a jailbroken device, remove Amber tweak becase this app will simply be overridden by it.

## Supported Devices

- iOS 14 or higher (iOS 13 or lower is not supported at the moment)
- iPhone or iPad with multiple of different flashlight LEDs (e.g. amber and regular white)
- Devices with single-color flashlight LED(s) are not supported, such as iPhone 4s and iPhone 5
- **iPhone 14 series and higher are not supported**, as [Apple has completely redesigned the flashlight LEDs](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/09/20/how-iphone-14-pro-adaptive-true-tone-flash-creates-perfect-light-for-your-photos)

## Usage (Quad-LEDs Devices)

Quad-LEDs devices are devices with four flashlight LEDs, two white and two amber. This includes the devices such as iPhone 11 and iPad Pro 3rd generation.

There are four sliders in the app:

1. `Cool LED 0` - The brightness of the first white LED
2. `Cool LED 1` - The brightness of the second white LED
3. `Warm LED 0` - The brightness of the first amber LED
4. `Warm LED 1` - The brightness of the second amber LED

Each slider can be adjusted independently. The more the value, the more brightness of the LED will get. If the value is set to 0, the LED will be off. If all sliders are set to 0, all LEDs will be off.

## Usage (Dual-LEDs Devices)

Dual-LEDs devices are devices with two different flashlight LEDs, such as iPhone 5s and iPhone SE 1st generation.

There are two sliders in the app:

1. `Torch Level` - The brightness of the LEDs
2. `Warmth` - The "warmth" of the light color

Unlike [Amber tweak](https://github.com/PoomSmart/Amber), this app cannot force the two LEDs to be on at the same time. You can use `Torch Level` slider to control the brightness of the LEDs just as you can from the Control Center, but the `Warmth` slider will only set the warm percentile of the scene. The more the value, the more brightness of the amber LED will get, resulting in a warmer light color. If `Warmth` is set to the max, only the amber LED will be on.

## Future Plans

1. More accessible sliders (are they too small?)
2. iOS 13 and lower support (iOS 7 is the theoretically lowest, but maybe iOS 8 is more realistic?) (the lower the iOS version, the less likely it will happen)
3. Fix app icon not showing when built as debian package (why?)
4. Build as a debian package
5. Better error handling?
6. Refactor code (well, a lot of them were suggested by GPT/Copilot and I don't usually write an iOS app)
7. See if any app entitlements are unnecessary
8. See if we can get a better app icon (I'm not a designer and the current one is evently generated by AI)
